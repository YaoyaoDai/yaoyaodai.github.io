<p>
I am a comparative politics scholar and quantitative social scientist. I will receive a dual-title Ph.D. from the Departments of Political Science and Asian Studies at Pennsylvania State University in August 2019. In the fall of 2019, I will join NYU Abu Dhabi as a Postdoctoral Researcher. In 2020, I will join the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at UNC Charlotte as an Assistant Professor. My substantive research interests include authoritarian politics, populism, and information manipulation. My methodological research focuses on computational social science, quantitative text analysis, measurement, and experiments.
