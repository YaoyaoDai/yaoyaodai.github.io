Welcome to my personal website! I am a comparative politics scholar and political methodologist. I will receive a dual-title Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science and the Department of Asian Studies at the Pennsylvania State University in August 2019. In the fall of 2019, I will join NYU Abu Dhabi as a Postdoctoral Researcher. In 2020, I will join the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at UNC Charlotte as an Assistant Professor. My substantive research interests include authoritarian politics, populism, and information manipulation. My methodological research focuses on computational social science, quantitative text analysis, measurement, and experiments.
