Welcome to my personal website! I am a comparative politics scholar and political methodologist. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at UNC Charlotte. Before joining UNCC, I was a post-doctoral associate in the Social Science Division at New York University Abu Dhabi. I received a dual-title Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science and the Department of Asian Studies at the Pennsylvania State University.  My substantive research interests include authoritarian politics, populism, and information manipulation. My methodological research focuses on computational social science, quantitative text analysis, measurement, and experiments.
