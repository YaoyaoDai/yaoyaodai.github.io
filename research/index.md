<p>
I am a comparative politics scholar and political methodologist with a substantive focus on <i>information manipulation</i>, authoritarian politics, Chinese politics, and populism, and methodological interests in experiments, measurement, quantitative text analysis, and computational social science. While I have a particular interest and expertise in China, I also have several research projects that address these topics in other regions of the world, including Africa, Europe, and Latin America.
