I am a comparative politics scholar and political methodologist with a substantive focus on <i>information manipulation</i>, <i>authoritarian politics</i>, <i>Chinese politics</i>, and <i>populism</i>, and methodological interests in <i>experiments</i>, <i>measurement</i>, <i>quantitative text analysis</i>, and <i>computational social science</i>. While I have a particular interest and expertise in China, I also have several research projects that address these topics in other regions of the world, including Africa, Europe, and Latin America.
