<p>
I am a comparative politics scholar and political methodologist with a substantive focus on *information manipulation*, *authoritarian politics*, *Chinese politics*, and *populism*, and methodological interests in *experiments*, *measurement*, *quantitative text analysis*, and _computational social science_. While I have a particular interest and expertise in China, I also have several research projects that address these topics in other regions of the world, including Africa, Europe, and Latin America.
