<p>
I am a comparative politics scholar and quantitative social scientist. I will receive a dual-title Ph.D. from the Departments of Political Science and Asian Studies at Pennsylvania State University in August 2019. In the fall of 2019, I will join NYU Abu Dhabi as a Postdoctoral Researcher before joining the UNC Charlotte Department of Political Science full time as an Assistant Professor in 2020. My substantive research interests include authoritarian politics, populism, and information manipulation. My methodological research focuses on computational social science, quantitative text analysis, measurement, and experiments.
